In this project we aim to find areas that have underserved Opioid Treatment Program providers. Opioid use disorder is a major problem in America and one thing that can help is to have an OTP provider. 
We find areas that either don't have an OTP provider nearby or areas where the OTP providers are overburdened. 
This aims at finding areas where more OTP providers are needed. By also including SVI data we find areas that are more vulnerable that would especially benefit from having a nearby OTP provider.
